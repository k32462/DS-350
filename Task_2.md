## "How many high school stars make it to the NBA?"

The graphics mentioned are from [**Pudding**](https://pudding.cool/2019/03/hype/)

What's really unique about this visualization is that it has gifs on both sides of the article of NBA movement. On the left there is a gif of an NBA player dunking during a warmup and on the right there is a high school player who shoots the ball from the halfcourt line. In both occurrances the gifs are slightly shaded dark until a cursor is moved over, then the gif is given it's full color.

Below the written article there are a few graphics that show how many of the top High School players made it to the NBA. This is a dot plot with several layers showing "below average","mediocre","great" players, etc. Once the cursor is a bove a certain dot in the dot plot, the names are also shown to the right of the graphic to show more specifics. There are also 2 more graphic below this that shown the same for players directly out of high school and the top #10 picks in the NBA draft. One thing it can do better on is that although the dot plots are really detailed and show the names for each data point according to the position of the cursor. It shows no names for the empty dots, this may be obvious but it also makes it harder to directly chose a dot in the plot. Continually, the titles could more specific in specifying that on the chart, their high school rank is mentioned as well as their success in basketball.

## Mental Health Disorders

Here is a research for [**mental health disorders**](https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health)

This article does a really good job of having the visuals for the information directly with the reader. In other words, the graphics to the paragraphs being read are always together with the graphics on the right. It's also very clear to read the titles and understand its purpose. It also has a section in which the reader can view all of the interactive charts in one sitting if desired. There is also a map graphic showing all of mental health disorders mapped globally to understand where the majority lie. Lastly, there is also a graph with a linear regression that displays a share of population with substance or mental disorders. This graph allows the user to view the regression line for this instance among all countries, each country is color coded by continent and the dots are sized by population size. Lastly, the user can also use a slider on the bottom to chose the year they wish to look into.

The only thing I think that they could do better is also incorporate the idea as the graphic into their bar plots. In the sense that once clicked on, it gives a run down of the statistics of that group. For example, to click on \[**Anxiety Disorders**\] bar and see if it's mostly men, what age group, and from what countries.

## Sacramento Kings

Here is an article about the [**Sacramento Kings**](https://https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-sacramento-kings-offense-is-playoff-worthy/) In this article there is a table that shows a graphic with NBA players and their 3-point percentages. Something really interesting about this graphic is that the higher the 3-point percentage of the player is, the darker the shade of purple is. This makes it easier to read. There are also videos placed within the article to demonstrate the success of the Sacramento Kings.

One thing that they could do better is have the videos automatically play as the user scrolls through instead of having to manually click play, this makes it more convenient for the user.

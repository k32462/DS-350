# Statistics-Notebook
This began as the textbook for Intermediate Statistics (Math 325) at BYU-Idaho. It aims to become a personal notebook for performing and interpreting statistical analyses in R.

This is a line from RStudio. Hey everyone! My name is Kenny Ceron and I'm from Los Angeles, California. This is my 4th semester at BYUI as a Data Science major. I love all things music, I play piano, guitar, percussion, and I've been in 3 A Cappella groups. I also love traveling! My favorite place that I've traveled to is Paris, France!

# Notebook for DS 350


This is a line from RStudio. Hey everyone! My name is Kenny Ceron and I'm from Los Angeles, California. This is my 4th semester at BYUI as a Data Science major. I love all things music, I play piano, guitar, percussion, and I've been in 3 A Cappella groups. I also love traveling! My favorite place that I've traveled to is Paris, France!
